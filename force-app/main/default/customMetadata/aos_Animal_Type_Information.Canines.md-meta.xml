        <value xsi:type="xsd:string">Many dog breeds are genetically predisposed to certain conditions, which are present from a young age, but generally, only cause symptoms as the animal ages. RSPCA does not perform testing other than a clinical examination to determine if, or at what stage, these conditions have developed in animals that are not showing clinical symptoms. I accept full responsibility for seeking professional advice about potential genetic disorders specific to the animal I am adopting.</value>
